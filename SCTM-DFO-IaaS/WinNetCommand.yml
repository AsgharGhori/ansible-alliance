# == Task Script ==
# Contains Tasks for handling all windows command editing.
# Called from a List Script

# Due to a bug with either Windows or Ansible, running commands as part of
# a loop seems to cause problems. Any command after the first risks producing
# a failure (error code 87) for unknown reasons. Thus, this scrips instead
# builds command strings which include all the necessary parameters
# and executes them together. More debugging is needed to determine the core
# issue, at which point the script may be changed to better fit the problem.
# == Possible bug sources ==
# Windows Server OS, 'net accounts' commands,
# 'win_command' ansible module, ansible command execution

# Expected vars/facts:
# - MachineDefaults {} (populated and with SecCat_TaskCat: {} entry)
# - UndoList []
# - SkipList []
# - SecCat
# - TaskCat
# - ComTasks [{}] (one object)
#   - Desc
#   - ID
#   - LineIdx
#   - Strip
#   - Command
#   - Parameter
#   - Value
